export const mitochondria_adv = "Mitochondria are membrane-bound cell organelles (mitochondrion, singular) that generate most of the chemical energy needed to power the cell's biochemical reactions. Chemical energy produced by the mitochondria is stored in a small molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Mitochondria contain their own small chromosomes. Generally, mitochondria, and therefore mitochondrial DNA, are inherited only from the mother" +
    " Mitochondria are membrane-bound with two different membranes. " +
    "These membranes are essential to produce energy (ATP). " + "Oxygen is used to create an electrochemical gradient across the membranes. " +
    "That gradient means when ADP moves through the membranes, it has enough energy to become ATP. " +
    "ATP is an energy source, because the phosphate (that the P in ATP) is a high-energy bond and if broken, releases energy that can be used for other reactions within the cell. " +
    " Some different cells have different amounts of mitochondria because they need more energy. So for example, the muscle has a lot of mitochondria, the liver does too, the kidney as well, and to a certain extent, the brain, which lives off of the energy those mitochondria produce. So if you have a defect in the pathways that the mitochondria usually functions with, you're going to have symptoms in the muscle, in the brain, sometimes in the kidneys as well; many different types of symptoms. And we probably don't know all of the different diseases that mitochondrial dysfunction causes."
